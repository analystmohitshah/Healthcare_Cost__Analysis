# Healthcare Expense Allocation & Analysis

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to transform transactional healthcare data into **analytical insights** by merging **expense** and **visit** datasets.  
The analysis focuses on:
- Calculating **expense per patient visit**
- Determining **average expense per functional health centre** (e.g., hospitals, long-term care, community services)

This type of analysis is crucial for **healthcare financial management**, enabling better:
- Budget allocation
- Resource planning
- Performance monitoring across institutions

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Sources
- **Expenses Dataset** ‚Üí Contains total healthcare expenses per organization and functional centre.  
- **Visits Dataset** ‚Üí Contains the number of patient visits per organization and functional centre.  

Both datasets share the keys:
- `organization_id` ‚Üí unique identifier for each healthcare organization  
- `functional_centre_number` ‚Üí unique identifier for each functional centre  

---

## üîë Key Steps

1. **Merge Datasets**  
   - Join `expenses` and `visits` on `organization_id` and `functional_centre_number`.  
   - Retain attributes: `organization_id`, `functional_centre_number`, `functional_centre_name`, `expenses`, and `visits`.  

2. **Calculate Expense Per Visit**  
   ```python
   merged_df["expense_per_visit"] = merged_df.apply(
       lambda row: row["expenses"]/row["visits"] if row["visits"] > 0 else 0, axis=1
   )s.

3. **Compute Average Expense Per health Centre**
- Group by `health_centre_number`, `health_centre_name`  
- Calculate the **mean expense per visit** for each centre  
- Store results in a summary table

## Example Output

### Final Merged Table (sample)
| organization_id | functional_centre_number | functional_centre_name | expenses | visits | expense_per_visit |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|----------|--------|-------------------|
| 101             | 5001                      | General Hospital        | 200000   | 400    | 500               |
| 102             | 5002                      | Long-term Care          | 150000   | 300    | 500               |

### Average Expense per Functional Centre
| functional_centre_number | functional_centre_name | average_expense_per_visit |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| 5001                      | General Hospital        | 520                        |
| 5002                      | Long-term Care          | 480                        |

## üìä Visualization
**Matplotlib Bar Chat** for comparision on Function Unit (Health Centre)
**Seaborn Boxplot** to compare distributions of expenses per visit across healthcare centres:  

---
# Interpretation:

Hospitals show higher variability in expenses per visit.

Long-term care centres demonstrate more consistency in cost per visit.

Outliers suggest potential inefficiencies or special cases (e.g., specialized treatments).
