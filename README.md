# Healthcare Expense Allocation & Analysis using Python

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to transform transactional healthcare data into **analytical insights** by merging **expense** and **visit** datasets.  
The analysis focuses on:
- Calculating **expense per patient visit**
- Determining **average expense per health centre** (e.g., hospitals, long-term care, community services)
- **Health centre** is the department or the unit in the organization.

This type of analysis is crucial for **healthcare financial management**, enabling better:
- Budget allocation
- Resource planning
- Performance monitoring across institutions

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Sources 
- **Expenses Dataset**([path/to/datasets ](https://github.com/analystmohitshah/healthcare-expense-analysis/blob/main/datasets/expenses.csv)) ‚Üí Contains total healthcare expenses per organization and health centre (department).  
- **Visits Dataset** (path/to/datasets) ‚Üí Contains the number of patient visits per organization and health centre (department).  

Both datasets share the keys:
- `organization_id` ‚Üí unique identifier for each healthcare organization  
- `functional_centre_number` ‚Üí unique identifier for each health centre  

---

## üîë Key Steps

1. **Merge Datasets**  
   - Join `expenses` and `visits` on `organization_id` and `functional_centre_number`.  
   - Retain attributes: `organization_id`, `functional_centre_number`, `functional_centre_name`, `expenses`, and `visits`.  

2. **Calculate Expense Per Visit**  
   ```python
merged_df['expense_per_visit'] = merged_df.apply(
    lambda row: row['expenses'] / row['visits'] if row['visits'] > 0 else 0,
    axis=1
).round(2)```

3. **Compute Average Expense Per health Centre**
- Group by `health_centre_number`, `health_centre_name`  
- Calculate the **mean expense per visit** for each centre  
- Store results in a summary table

## Example Output

### Final Merged Table (sample)
| organization_id | health_centre_number | health_centre_name             | expenses | visits  | expense_per_visit |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|----------|---------|-------------------|
|   1             | 82                   | Mental Health Specialty Clinic | 500000.0 | 0.0     | 0.0               |
|   2             | 10                   | Medical Specialty Clinic       | 500000.0 | 10909.0 | 275.0             |



### Average Expense per health Centre
| health_centre_number | health_centre_name | average_expense_per_visit |
|----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| 10                   | Medical Specialty Clinic  | 251.25             |
| 50                   | Diabetes Specialty Clinic | 480                |

# Interpretation:

Hospitals show higher variability in expenses per visit.

Long-term care centres demonstrate more consistency in cost per visit.

Outliers suggest potential inefficiencies or special cases (e.g., specialized treatments).
